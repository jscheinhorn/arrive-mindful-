                <p>
                  At Arrive Mindful we believe the benefit of dedicated
                  mindfulness practice extends beyond the individual. In our
                  “Yoga Philosophy” (Insert link to yoga philosophy tab) section
                  you can find information on the holistic reach of yoga into
                  every aspect of life and being. In our “Mindfulness and Mental
                  Health” (insert link to mindfulness and mental health section)
                  section, you can find information about how mindfulness has
                  been found to promote various aspects of psychological
                  well-being like psychosocial resilience and posttraumatic
                  growth. We believe in the power of such enlightening practices
                  to expand universal consciousness promoting peace and
                  well-being for all. Our liberation is inherently caught up in
                  one another. Whether this is interpreted as referring to the
                  fundamental understanding that one cannot help others before
                  helping oneself, or as a notion reliant on aspects of being
                  tied to the metaphysical realm is of little importance. The
                  outcome, karma, or consequence is the same. When we free
                  ourselves from the chains that individually bind us, we allow
                  space and energy to support others in doing so for themselves.
                  This can happen on an interpersonal (person to person, friend
                  to friend), community (local organizations and programs), or
                  global level (international cooperation, diplomacy, and
                  progressive action towards sustainable development). Through
                  practice we can cultivate a space for internal refuge while
                  extending an invitation for healing to humanity, the planet,
                  and all beings that dwell upon it. The more individuals,
                  communities, and international organizations we can spread
                  this message to, the closer we are to global liberation.
                  Imagine a world where we all live peacefully on our planet
                  while protecting it from further harm and degradation, in a
                  society built on equity, harmony, and thriving.

                  Yoga, Mindfulness and the Global Conversation
                </h2>
                <p>
                  On June 27, 2019, yoga guru and teacher, Sadhguru spoke to the
                  UN Assembly Hall in Geneva, in conversation with Dr Soumya
                  Swaminathan, Chief Scientist at the World Health Organization,
                  and Francis Gurry, Director General of the World Intellectual
                  Property Organization as part of the 5th Annual International
                  Day of Yoga celebration. The talk was titled, “Yoga – The
                  Power of Inclusion.” Many of the UN agendas aim to promote
                  inclusion and equity as part of their mission for peace and
                  prosperity for all. In his conversation with these high-level
                  world leaders, Sadhguru artfully described how the philosophy
                  and true practice of yoga inherently promotes these agendas in
                  its teachings. Yoga is more than the physical practice of
                  asana; it is a holistic practice that embodies well-being of
                  the physical, breath, mind, and spirit.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Opening remarks highlight the mission of the UN to achieve
                  world peace, global health/well-being, disarmament, and
                  sustainable development knitting together how principles of
                  yoga can support these goals by working in the spirit of
                  cooperation, compromise, unity, and inclusivity. Sadhguru
                  suggests that yogic philosophy understands human beings to be
                  inclusive not by choice, but by the nature of existence. It is
                  only by constant transaction with everything around us that we
                  persist and that we are, in the most fundamental of terms a
                  consequence of the interplay of complexity and diversity. He
                  asserts that while our individuality is inherently true, we
                  have taken this reality too seriously. According to yogic
                  philosophy, we do not end at our skin. Even if we do not
                  consider the idea of a boundless energy that is our spiritual
                  body, the basic truth is that we effect the world and people
                  around us. If we cultivate hatred, negativity, and violence
                  within ourselves, this is what we will bring into the world.
                  On an individual scale this may seem tolerable and manageable.
                  However, bring together an army of people breeding this same
                  hatred, negativity, and violence, we suddenly have a recipe
                  for war and terror.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Through the practice of yoga, one mindfully obliterates the
                  boundaries created with the body and mind to expand
                  consciousness beyond the self. Suddenly the lines of
                  intension, action, and consequence begin to blur and
                  integrate. The resulting reality manifests without a need to
                  teach morality and ethics. Such concepts would flow
                  organically from the behavior of the conscious and mindful
                  individual. If one understands the nature of her existence to
                  extend beyond herself, having a profound effect not only on
                  herself, but the world around her, she will not need to be
                  taught tolerance, the importance of unity, and the need for an
                  inclusive and equitable society.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sadhguru demonstrates this point in saying, “the nature of
                  your individual existence is a very flimsy thing…the way you
                  are identifying what is me and what is not me is by
                  sensation.” He then points to a glass of water gesturing to it
                  as he explains his thoughts about yoga to obliterate the
                  boundaries of self and the resulting morality to the audience.
                  “There is a glass of water here, is it you? No. When you drink
                  the water does it become you? You have included it within the
                  boundaries of your sensation…yoga stretches the boundaries of
                  your sensation…your sensory body expands, then you will
                  experience all of these people as a part of yourself as you
                  experience your five fingers as yourself…even for a moment of
                  feeling all of these people as a part of yourself, would you
                  need teaching of morality?”
                </p>
                <p>
                  The conversation continues examining topics ranging from
                  education, intellect, artificial intelligence, universal or
                  cosmic intelligence, and the technological revolution.
                  Sadhguru suggests that technology may relieve us from the
                  burden we carry with the idea that we must hold all the
                  answers in our individual minds. Technology frees us from that
                  burden, yet we fear it because of the nature of the powers who
                  often manage and control it. If placed into the wrong hands,
                  technology could be detrimental to our well-being as a planet.
                  However, there is enormous potential for technology to
                  liberate us from the chains of intellectual striving that may
                  keep us bound. We must reimagine how we educate our children,
                  focusing on expanding consciousness so that morality and
                  inclusion are second nature rather than competition and
                  conflict. Only then can we trust that technological
                  advancements will do better than harm. Technology does not
                  have the capability to be conscious. Artificial intelligence
                  can free us from focusing so intensely on intellectual
                  advancement, thus manifesting a world free to explore
                  expanding human consciousness, creativity, and innovation. In
                  this world that inherently promotes inclusivity, peace, and
                  equity, this kind of revolution of consciousness is possible.
                  He says, “the moment you identify with your intelligence you
                  sleep through your entire life…your wakefulness is your life.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sadhguru continues to stress that this yogic way of thinking
                  must be promoted among global policy makers and those in
                  positions of power. When the authorities can appreciate the
                  oneness of being, they may be able to consider what impact
                  policies will have on the community, water, forest, and air in
                  a more holistic manner. This underpins the importance of
                  promoting mindfulness practices in education, political
                  systems, and international platforms. The concepts of yogic
                  philosophy need not be considered solely as a tool for
                  individual growth. On the contrary, the teachings must be
                  understood in secular practice to bolster expansive thinking
                  towards global consciousness operating from a foundation of
                  peace, prosperity and thriving for all.

                <p>
                  Around the world, mindfulness practices and yoga are gaining
                  attention for their many individual psychological, cognitive,
                  emotional, physiological, and spiritual benefits. On December
                  11, 2014, the United Nations officially recognized the
                  potential for yoga to have a global impact declaring June 21st
                  the International Day of Yoga through resolution 69/131. The
                  resolution was first proposed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi
                  of India at the 69th Session of the General Assembly. The
                  Mission of India to the UN brought the resolution to the floor
                  where it was endorsed by 175 member states. In his proposal,
                  Prime Minister Modi was quoted as saying, “yoga embodies unity
                  of mind and body, thought and action…yoga is not just about
                  exercise, it is a way to discover the sense of oneness with
                  yourself, the world and the nature.” Read more about the

                  Yoga was first incorporated into UN activities in the 1960’s
                  by way of the UN Staff Recreation Council (UNSRC) sponsoring
                  the UNSRC Yoga Club. The club recognizes that yoga embodies
                  many of the principles promoted by the United Nations like
                  peace, solidarity, interconnectedness, pursuit of well-being,
                  and respect for the planet. The club promotes yoga activities
                  and philosophy among the UN community clearly stating that it
                  is a secular organization, with no religious affiliation.{' '}

                <p>
                  In 2020, during the start of the Covid-19 global outbreak, UN
                  organizations regularly disseminated materials to help people
                  cope with the new and vastly different circumstances
                  individuals and families had to grapple with. For instance,
                  the UNICEF published a{' '}

                  highlighting key recommendations on how to talk to your
                  children about the pandemic, how to maintain a routine while
                  working and learning from home, and how to manage
                  interpersonal conflicts and increased stress. In a tip on
                  stress reduction, the article details steps to practice a
                  mindfulness exercise and breath meditation. This is further
                  evidence that UN organizations are recognizing the need for
                  mindfulness in promoting well-being especially during such
                  challenging times.

                  The importance of mindfulness in coping with pandemic-related

                  The World Health Organization (WHO) has emphasized the
                  physical and psychological benefits of yoga in important
                  initiatives and recommendations. For instance, in opening
                  remarks of a March 20, 2020, media briefing,{' '}

                    WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus stressed the
                    usefulness of yoga in his tips for living well while life
                    was increasingly moving into the home
                  </a>
                  . Additionally, the WHO Global Action Plan on Physical
                  Activity 2018-2030 calls for investments into policies to
                  promote physically active lifestyles around the world to
                  achieve the UN 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This
                  initiative specifically cites yoga as a useful tool in
                  managing health for individuals, communities, and the planet.

                <p>
                  Since 2014, the world has celebrated the beauty and power of
                  yoga each year on June 21st, the International Day of Yoga.
                  The day was first declared into being in December of 2014. In
                  the 69th Session of the UN General Assembly Agenda item 124,
                  world leaders reaffirmed previous UN agendas calling for the
                  recognition of the importance of individuals and communities
                  to cultivate healthy habits and lifestyle choices as a global
                  health mission. This initiative is in line with Goal 3 of the
                  2030 UN Agenda for Sustainable Development, targeting health
                  and well-being for all (SDG 3). Target 3.4 of this agenda pays
                  particular attention to global mental health. Given what we
                  know about the benefits of yoga for the body and mind, it is
                  no wonder the UN community has chosen to recognize the
                  practice with this international celebration.
                </p>

                <p>
                  On June 19, 2020, as part of the 6th Annual International Day
                  of Yoga, the UN celebrated with an array of programs put
                  together virtually. One of the focuses of the day was to
                  counteract anxiety and depression that had been on the rise
                  because of the initial pandemic shutdowns and stay-at-home
                  orders. The celebration was held under the theme, “Yoga for
                  Health – Yoga at Home.” Many yoga teachers, practitioners, UN
                  workers, and community members alike shared experiences with
                  how regular yoga practice helped decrease stress and anxiety
                  during the early days of the pandemic. In fact, we at Arrive
                  Mindful can relate to these anecdotes. The site was initially
                  inspired in response to our founder using her yoga practice to
                  manage Covid related stress while recognizing the need for
                  even more dedicated practice with her students and
                  increasingly moving to online learning.

                  At the 6th Annual Celebration of the International Day of
                  Yoga, world leaders like Tijani Muhammad-Bande (Nigeria),
                  President of the General Assembly and T.S. Tirumurti,
                  Permanent Representative of India to the UN, agreed that
                  health should no longer be considered simply the state of not
                  being sick; rather, that health should apply to enhanced
                  well-being and thriving. The day celebrated yoga’s global
                  appeal, and substantial evidence to support it is use in
                  promoting global health and well-being in the medical and
                  scientific community.
