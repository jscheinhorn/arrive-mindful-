                Five ways to bring mindfulness into your day
              </h1>
              <p>
                In recent years there’s been a lot of talk about mindfulness and
                its multiple health benefits. Studies have shown that practicing
                mindfulness can decrease stress and improve mood, but what is
                mindfulness, and how can we attain it? Mindfulness is not
                complicated or illusive at all. It is an innate ability we all
                have. We must simply choose to direct our awareness to our
                thoughts, feelings, and senses. It is the act of paying
                attention in a way to the present moment, with intent and
                without judgement. This doesn’t mean that it’s always easy. Just
                as honing any skill takes practice, so does the cultivation of
                mindfulness. To help you get started, we’ve put together a list
                of a few simple ways you can begin to introduce mindfulness into
                your daily life.

              <h2 className="mb-3 mt-5">#1 Mindfulness Meditation</h2>
              <p>
                {' '}
                Meditation is simpler than most people realize. The mind can be
                filled with thoughts, ideas, worries, and stories. It is not the
                practice of meditation to simply will away these phenomena.
                Mindfulness meditation guides you to direct your awareness to an
                aspect of your consciousness. This focus can be internal or
                external. Examples of an internal focal point are the mental
                repetition of a meditation word or mantra or focus on a bodily
                sensation like that of your breath. Meditation using an external
                focal point may be gazing at the flame of a burning candle. The
                important aspect of meditation is not the focal point, but the
                quality of awareness. This awareness is called mindfulness. You
                can start with only five minutes a day and increase that time as
                you see fit. Every little bit counts. If you have time to check
                your social media account, or binge watch the latest Netflix
                craze, you have time to devote to your mental well-being. Here
                is a great five-minute mindfulness meditation that you can
                listen to to get started.

              <h2>#2 Sensation Jar</h2>
              <p>
                {' '}
                Another great way to bring mindfulness into your every day life
                is to keep a sensation jar. Find a moment each day to write, on
                a small piece of paper, two observations from each of your five
                senses. Fold it up and slip it into your favorite little vessel
                when you get home. Keeping a sensation jar can help you to
                become more aware of your sensory experience in the moment. That
                increased awareness of the present moment is the cultivation of
                mindfulness.
              </p>
              <h2>#3 Mindful Action</h2>
              <p>
                Choose one action per day that you can do without interruption.
                Start by picking a relatively neutral activity: drinking your
                morning coffee, brushing your teeth or eating a meal. Do nothing
                else but that action. Notice the taste, the smell, the
                sensations of the experience. You can name the sensations as you
                experience them: “warm”- but refrain from judgements like
                “tasty”. These are judgments and encourage further thought about
                the experience, rather than awareness of the experience itself.
                Simply notice.
              </p>
              <h2>#4 Walk Mindfully</h2>
              <p>
                Walking meditation is a common mindfulness practice. If walking
                to your car or the train is a regular part of your day, try
                doing it with awareness. It is easy to be completely unaware
                within the parts of your day that are most routine. So even if
                it is just a walk from your front door to your car, try
                committing to making that walk a mindful one. Pay attention to
                the sensation of your foot on the walkway. Feel the weight
                transition from your heel to the ball of your foot. Where is
                your left foot, your right foot? Feel the weight on the ball of
                your left foot flow into the heel of your right, and vice versa.
                Maintain your awareness on the sensations of walking.
              </p>
              <h2>#5 Stop, Look and Listen</h2>
              <p>
                So much of the time, we communicate with those who are closest
                to us with the same monotony that we approach our daily chores.
                We talk on the phone with loved ones while cooking dinner,
                watching television or washing the dishes. Try putting a stop to
                these distractions while hearing about someone’s day. If you are
                in the company of that person, look them in the eye and simply
                listen. Hear what they have to say and refrain from the natural
                tendency to give advice or share a similar story of your own.
                Start by asking someone in your life how their day was and
                simply listen to their response. Remain aware of your urge to
                interject, without giving into that urge. Remain in the present
                moment with that person and use it as an opportunity to practice
                mindfulness.
