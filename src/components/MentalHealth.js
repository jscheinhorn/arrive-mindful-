                <p>
                  Unfortunately, it is safe to say that most of us will
                  experience some form of hardship in our lifetimes. For some,
                  that adversity is more extreme, like in cases of trauma, death
                  of a close loved one, or severe and chronic illness. For
                  others, simply facing the day-to-day stress of life is enough
                  to feel rundown, anxious, or depressed. In recent years,
                  psychological researchers have been looking into what personal
                  attributes and clinical interventions might promote resilient
                  outcomes in the face of adversity with increasing promise.
                  Many studies suggest that practices involving mindfulness,
                  meditation, and yoga offer encouraging evidence to push the
                  field of psychosocial resilience in this direction.

                <h2 className="mb-3 mt-5">
                  What are resilience and posttraumatic growth?
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Some would define psychological resilience as the capacity of
                  a person’s emotional system to withstand or recover from
                  significant challenges that threaten its stability, viability,
                  or development (Wagnild and Young, 1993). Others have defined
                  resilience as a positive outcome where an individual does not
                  simply resist risk, but exhibits psychological growth
                  reflecting positive self-concept, self-esteem, and life
                  satisfaction (Sehgal and Kaur, 2016). This second definition
                  is distinct from the first in that it includes language
                  connoting posttraumatic growth (PTG); positive psychological
                  adaptation experienced as a direct result of highly
                  challenging life circumstances, trauma, or adversity.
                  Mindfulness is an important tool thought to bolster resilient
                  and PTG outcomes following trauma, adversity, or loss.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Among a myriad of traits that constitute PTG includes a new
                  and positive perception of self, like Considering oneself no
                  longer a victim but a survivor (Wagnild and Young, 1993).
                  Mindfulness can help the individual to relinquish the old
                  stories of victimhood and self-blame that are often associated
                  with posttraumatic rumination. Once that space opens up for
                  new ways of thinking, meditators can reframe their
                  self-concept in a new, brighter light. Yoga practices can fill
                  in the residual gaps with a sense of accomplishment,
                  self-esteem, and equanimity. Meanwhile, social adaptation and
                  growth may involve interpersonal relationships, like becoming
                  closer to one’s friends or relatives in the wake of trauma.
                  Getting involved in mindfulness-based groups and communities
                  can help individuals cultivate like-minded social support
                  systems that offer a stable foundation to begin building back
                  a life that is enjoyable and fulfilling. This community, or
                  sangha serves as a consistent reminder of the love and
                  supportive relationships that are available to each of us
                  while holding the whole group accountable for maintaining a
                  healthy lifestyle for the body and mind. In reframing one’s
                  thoughts about their trauma and finding a supportive community
                  to hold space for the rebuilding process, one’s philosophy of
                  life can change by reassessing priorities, finding greater
                  meaning, and life satisfaction. In this way, PTG refers to
                  psychological resilience promoting not only a return to
                  baseline, but a raising of the bar so to speak. The resilient
                  individual finds a renewed appreciation for life, enhanced
                  connection to others, reinvigorated personal strength,
                  openness to new possibilities, increased sense of purpose, and
                  spiritual growth. Many new areas of psychology, like positive
                  psychology and spiritual psychology recognize with increasing
                  notoriety the benefits of mindfulness, meditation and yoga in
                  promoting PTG responses to aversive life events.

                  How can mindfulness, yoga, and flow help?
                </h2>
                <p>
                  It is well known that mindfulness practices promote
                  psychological well-being, concentration, positive affect, and
                  improved mood (Keng et al, 2011). Yet, what really is
                  mindfulness? Mindfulness has been defined as paying attention
                  in a particular way, on purpose, in the present moment, and
                  non-judgmentally (Butzer et al, 2016). Awareness and
                  non-judgmental acceptance of one’s moment to moment experience
                  are two elements of mindfulness thought to buffer against
                  certain forms of psychological distress including rumination,
                  anger, and anxiety (Keng et al, 2011). Theoretically speaking,
                  mindfulness practices can help individuals to stop avoiding,
                  suppressing or over-engaging their negative emotions, while
                  bringing positive emotions more consciously to the forefront
                  of the mind (Keng et al, 2011). There are many forms of
                  mindfulness proven to enhance positive psychological states
                  including meditation and yoga, though yoga is seldom
                  researched relative to various forms of seated meditation or
                  guided imagery.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Yoga is an ancient Eastern philosophy of uniting body, breath,
                  and mind. The practice involves concentrated awareness to
                  guide mindful breathing exercises (pranayama), body postures
                  (asana), and coordinated body movements with breath (Pratap
                  Ana or vinyasa). Many long-term practitioners site yoga as a
                  transformative and transcendent experience cultivating a state
                  of flow in the present moment extending into their day-to-day
                  lives. The enhanced quality of life experienced by many yogis
                  has influenced some psychological clinicians to begin
                  integrating yoga into therapeutic practice inspiring new
                  modalities like Integral Yoga Therapy (Miovic, 2018). Both
                  yoga philosophy and researchers in positive psychology are
                  focused on supporting individuals to achieve objective
                  wellbeing and the cultivation of a life rich with meaning and
                  depth. Moreover, studies interested in the new and exciting
                  field of “flow” experiences of yoga practitioners is not yet
                  very common but becoming an area of increasing interest based
                  on the numerous benefits of the practice.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In a similar vein, although qualitatively somewhat different,
                  psychological flow has been described as a state that emerges
                  from the moment-to-moment experience of mindfulness (Butzer et
                  al, 2016). Thus, some researchers argue that mindfulness is an
                  essential element of the flow experience. Csikszentmihalyi
                  identified eight characteristics that constitute flow. Among
                  them are focused attention, immersive potential for attention,
                  autonomy or self-control, and muted self-awareness or
                  dissolution of ego (Butzer et al, 2016) - all of which fall
                  well within the limits of qualities cultivated in mindfulness
                  practice. Ultimately, flow is thought to require an optimal
                  balance of the challenges associated with an activity and the
                  skill an individual possesses to perform said activity (Butzer
                  et al, 2016).

                <p>
                  At Arrive Mindful we believe that mental health and well-being
                  can be achieved in a myriad of ways. We consider mindfulness
                  practices essential elements in healing and promoting peace
                  from the individual to the global spheres. Peace starts from
                  within. Just as we do our individual part to protect our
                  planet by recycling, reducing waste, and minimizing our
                  individual carbon footprint; we believe that cultivating
                  individual peace and harmony is the first step in promoting
                  peace and equity around the world. This is why we have
                  sections of our page for both personal development, and global
                  engagement. Our liberation is caught up in one another. As we
                  nourish peace and well-being within ourselves, we encourage
                  others to do the same. We hope this message will spread like
                  wildfire, liberating the whole planet!
